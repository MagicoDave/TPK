//HOW TO PLAY
htp0=How to play
htp1=In Total Party Kill, you have to stop the raiding aventurers from destroying the Orc Village! To do so, you can setup towers to stop them dead on their tracks!
towers=Towers
htp2=This is a fundation, you can press on it to see what towers you can build
htp3=This is an Arrow Tower, it doesnt do a lot of damage but its fast, cheap and has good reach!
htp4=This is a Witch Tower, it packs a punch but it doesn't reach as far and its a bit more expensive
htp5=This is a Sticky Tower, it can reduce in half the speed of your foes!
htp6=This is a Cyclops Tower, it rocks. Literally. Heavy dmg, reach and price. A bit slow, tho
enemies=Enemies
htp7=This is a farmer. It dies easily, but they come in big numbers.
htp8=This is a barbarian. Be scared, because this big guy can take a beating no problem
htp9=The sneaky rogue. It's fast. Very. Kill him even faster.
htp10=This is a mage. It not very tough, but he will absolutely decimate your lifes if he manages to come through
resources=Resources
htp11=Gold. You use this to build towers. Towers kill enemies. Enemies drop gold when they are dead.
htp12=Lifes. If you run out of these, you lose! Don't let raiders get through!
htp13=The almighty Rage Button. Press it when you are in need and your towers will attack twice as fast for a few seconds!
